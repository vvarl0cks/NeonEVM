Neon EVM is a fully compatible Ethereum environment solution built on the Solana blockchain. The platform allows developers to deploy Ethereum dApps without undertaking any reconfiguration.

`Minimal reconfiguration required: allowing Ethereum developers to build without Rust.`

Neon EVM enables Solidity- and Vyper-based dApps to tap into Solana’s network benefits: low fees, high transaction speeds, and parallel transaction execution capabilities.

From a developer’s perspective, this means creating Solana-compatible contracts using tools you’re familiar with from the Ethereum Ecosystem.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
